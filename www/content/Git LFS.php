Especially when a team is working on projects which have large files/multimedia like Game,AR/VR development, GIT LFS plays a vital role in maintaining the repository. <br><br>Git Large File Storage (LFS) replaces large files with pointer references inside Git and these files are stored in another server with a large size. When we make a commit and push the code, these large files automatically get redirected to the LFS servers without any manual intervention. <br><br>To set up LFS, we need to run the following command in the terminal :<br><br>1. Initialise git LFS system:<br><br><code><br>git lfs install<br></code><br><br>2. Then add files to track:<br><code>git lfs track "*.psd"</code><br><br>3. Commit and push the .gitattributes file.<br><br>All the files that LFS tracks get separated from the main repo and will be stored separately. This saves a lot of space and time manually clearing the disk space or creating a new repository whenever the storage becomes full.<br></div></body></html><br><br><?php include "../footer/footer.php"; ?>
