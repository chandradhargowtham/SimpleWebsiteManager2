We can use the same keyword to include other php files too.<br><br><b>Syntax :</b><br><code>&lt?php include "header.html" ?&gt</code><br><code>&lt?php include "content.html" ?&gt</code><br><code>&lt?php include "footer.html" ?&gt</code><br>Details:<br><br>1. Create separate html files and put them in the base folder(where the intended php file will be located).<br>2. Add the above code to the php file.<br>3. Run the php file when the server is on.<br>4. Now we have one centralized page which is a combination of multiple HTML pages - modular design 101. </div></body></html><br><br><?php include "../footer/footer.php"; ?>
