A git host is a platform where we can store our files whereas a git client is a tool that helps us to access and manage the repositories by adding,removing or modifying the files.<br>We have a variety of git hosts. The most popular ones are GitHub and Bitbucket. They have their own git clients i.e. Github Desktop and Sourcetree. We can also use git from command line. All of them differ in the way they look but function the same. <br><br><b>Create a new Repository : </b><br>We can create a repository from the git host itself. First, create an account and login. Then :<br>1. Github : <a href="https://github.com/new"> https://github.com/new </a><br>2. BitBucket : <a href="https://bitbucket.org/repo/create"> https://bitbucket.org/repo/create </a><br><br>Then, we clone the repository on our computer using a git client.<br><b> Git Clone :</b>Cloning is a process of creating an identical copy of the repository locally (on our computer). We clone a repository, then update it and commit the changes (more about commit in the next article).<br><br><b>Cloning a repository :</b><br><br><b>Github Desktop : </b> File &gt Clone Repository <br>Method 1:  Choose the newly created repository (will be found if logged in with the same account)<br>Method 2:  Click on the Code button (found after the repository is opened on github.com) and copy the URL and paste it in the URL field in Github Desktop.<br><img src="../content/images/2020-12-25git3.PNG" width="921" height="450"><br><br><br><b>Source Tree : </b> <br>Method 1: File &gt Clone/New - Click on remote and refresh the list - Select the repository.<br>Method 2: Copy the URL from the repository on bitbucket and paste it in the URL field.<br><img src="../content/images/2020-12-25git4.PNG" width="921" height="450"><br><br><br>Choose the folder where you want to clone the repository. We can copy our files to that folder and start using the project. Git will start tracking every change in that folder. The next time we open our client, we can see the changes onscreen.<br><br>To create a repository via CLI (Command Line Interface) locally, we usethe <i>git init</i> command.<br><code> git init <folder name></code><br><br>We have the repository setup and git is tracking changes. We have to make a <i>commit</i> and a <i>push</i> to save files on the server(git host like github/bitbucket). More about commit and push in the next article.</div></body></html><br><br><?php include "../footer/footer.php"; ?>
