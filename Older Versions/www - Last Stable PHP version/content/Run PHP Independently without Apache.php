Open Command Prompt (Win key + R)<br><br><img src="../content/images/2020-09-26cmd.PNG" width="500" height="400"><br><br><br>2.  CD (Change Directory) to the working directory  (location of the php files). We can use the "cd.." or "cd\" commands to go back while navigating.<br><br>3. Type in : <br><br><b>Code Snippet</b><br><code>php -S localhost:4000</code><br><br>4. We can access the php files in the browser via the URL - "localhost:4000/yourPHPfile.php" (without quotes).<br><br><b>Note:</b><br>1. The "localhost:4000" part is the TCP port. You can consider these ports as communications endpoints on a particular IP address (localhost here). Other ports like 8080 can also be used.<br><br>2. This feature is available only on PHP versions > 5.4.<br><br>3. As mentioned in the PHP website , The built-in web server is meant for development only and doesn't provide much of the features that are present in other web servers like Apache.<br></div></body></html><br><br><?php include "../footer/footer.php"; ?>
