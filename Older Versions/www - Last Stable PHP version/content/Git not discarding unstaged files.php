<?php include "../header/header.php"; ?><html><body><div class="container"><br><h1>Git not discarding unstaged files</h1><br><br><br>Sometimes, the unstaged files in git may not get discarded/removed even after running the discard command. This can happen due to the file pointers not referencing respective files. <br><br><b>Cause : </b> I have encountered it when someone pushes existing files in a repository via GIT LFS . those files will have their references changed by GIT LFS (They will be stored in a LFS server). This mostly happens if we set up LFS in an existing repository where the files are already on the git storage. A new redirect to LFS can cause this issue.<br><br><b> Error Message :</b><br> <code>Encountered 1 file(s) that should have been pointers, but weren't:<br>        [filename]</code><br><br><b>Fix : </b> <br><br>In the terminal,<br>1. A <code> git reset --hard</code> generally helps.<br>2. If it doesn't help, we can do a force checkout - <code> git checkout --force [Branch Name] </code>. The --force flag/option will proceed with the checkout process even if the working tree differs from the HEAD. This will delete all the local changes. <br>3. Commit all the files using the -a tag and then revert the commit.<br><br><b> Caution : </b> Backup your files first before proceeding with any of these fixes.</div></body></html><br><br><?php include "../footer/footer.php"; ?>
